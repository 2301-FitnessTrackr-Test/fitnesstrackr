# Hi Violet!

## Steps to the Git workflow after someone has written some finalized code:
- Note: You should only be doing this if you can confirm that your code is error / bug-free. 

- Step 1: Make a new branch for yourself. 
- Step 2: Add, commit, and push the work to Github 
    - Note: REMEMBER to upload your code ONLY to your specific branch. 
    - NEVER UPLOAD DIRECTLY TO THE MAIN / MASTER / DEFAULT BRANCH
